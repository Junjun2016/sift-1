This is a SIFT object recognition library for C++ and Python.  It is
based on Rob Hess' SIFT feature detector[1].

To build:

1. Install the following packages (Ubuntu 8.10):
  Dev tools:
    autoconf
    automake
    libtool
  Vision/image processing libraries:
    libcv1
    libcv-dev
    gsl-dev
    libgsl0-dev

2. ./autogen.sh && ./configure && make

See src/tests/test_sift.py for what the library is capable of at the
moment.
